# Augean Stables - solution

It's necessary to use LP with a particular technique when deciding how much to work. This is necessary because it's not possible to have the number of hours worked as a variable because the multiplications would make the problem not linear. Pay attention to the fact that $h_1$, $h_2$, and $h_3$ are the same for all the stables, not one for each stable.

To limit the number of combinations to try, start with a base configuration where it's only possible to increase the number of hours worked on a canal (for example, canal A) and only decrease the number of hours worked on the other canal (for example, canal B). While the number of hours worked on each canal is acceptable (no less than 0 hours and no more than 24 hours), solve the current configuration. If the problem is not feasible, increase the number of hours worked on A (the only possible way to increase the total number of hours worked). In this case, it's also necessary to check if the new total number of hours is greater than previously found, meaning that it does not make sense to test the new configuration, and it's necessary to decrease the number of hours worked on B (the only possible way to decrease the total number of hours worked). If the problem is feasible, check if the total number of hours worked is better than previously found and decrease the number of hours worked on B.
