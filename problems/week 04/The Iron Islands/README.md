# The Iron Islands - solution

It is possible to divide the resolution into two steps:
- The best path is inside a waterway. For this solution, it is possible to use the sliding window technique inside each waterway to find the maximum number of islands that can be taken.
- The best path extends over two waterways. Because it is necessary to follow a straight path, it is possible to start in one waterway and finish in another. This means that the number of men needed is the sum of the number of men needed to conquer part of the first waterway and part of the second one, making sure to not count two times the number of men needed to conquer the central islands. It is better to find all the partial sums of men needed to conquer the first $i$ islands of each waterway, starting from the center, while reading the input.

  To find the final answer, it would be just necessary to find the two parts of the waterways that have the right number of men and the biggest number of islands. After sorting all the partial sums (each partial sum is linked to a number of islands in a certain waterway), it is possible to use two indexes, one starting from the beginning of the vector and one starting from the end, that move towards each other depending on the value of the sum of the two partial sums. It is necessary to make sure that the given sum is not made by two partial sums in the same waterway.
