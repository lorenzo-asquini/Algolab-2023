It is possible to store the friends' strength in a vector that can be ordered from the strongest to the weakest. It's important to sort the vector by placing the strongest friend first because it removes some computation by skipping all weaker friends if one does not have a matching box. To store the boxes, it is possible to use a map that maps keys representing the weight of a box to the number of boxes with that weight.

For every cycle, it is necessary to add 2 minutes that are needed to go down the stairs. In each cycle, for every friend, it is necessary to find the first box that he can carry (the boxes are ordered from the lightest to the heaviest). To do so, a fast way to find a good starting point is to use `map.lower_bound(strength)`, which returns an iterator to the element in the map with a key that is greater or equal to the needed strength. If it's equal, a box is taken. If it's greater, it is necessary to iterate over the keys to find a good box. If no box is found, no one of the following friends can take any box. When a box is taken, the counter decreases. If the counter reaches 0, the box key is removed from the map. After every friend has taken or not taken a box, if there are no boxes remaining, the work is done. Otherwise, a minute is added to count for the upstairs part.
